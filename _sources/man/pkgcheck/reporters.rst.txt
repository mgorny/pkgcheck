Reporters
=========

BinaryPickleStream
------------------

Dump a binary pickle stream using the highest pickling protocol.

Unlike `PickleStream`_ which uses the most compatible pickling protocol
available, this uses the newest version so it won't be compatible with
older versions of Python.

For more details of the stream, see `PickleStream`_.

CsvReporter
-----------

Comma-separated value reporter, convenient for shell processing.

Example::

    ,,,"global USE flag 'big-endian' is a potential local, used by 1 package: dev-java/icedtea-bin"
    sys-apps,portage,2.1-r2,sys-apps/portage-2.1-r2.ebuild has whitespace in indentation on line 169
    sys-apps,portage,2.1-r2,"rdepend  ppc-macos: unsolvable default-darwin/macos/10.4, solutions: [ >=app-misc/pax-utils-0.1.13 ]"
    sys-apps,portage,2.1-r2,"no change in 75 days, keywords [ ~x86-fbsd ]"

FancyReporter
-------------

Colored output grouped by result scope.

Example::

    sys-apps/portage
      WrongIndentFound: sys-apps/portage-2.1-r2.ebuild has whitespace in indentation on line 169
      NonsolvableDeps: sys-apps/portage-2.1-r2: rdepend  ppc-macos: unsolvable default-darwin/macos/10.4, solutions: [ >=app-misc/pax-utils-0.1.13 ]
      StableRequest: sys-apps/portage-2.1-r2: no change in 75 days, keywords [ ~x86 ]

FormatReporter
--------------

Custom format string reporter.

JsonReporter
------------

Feed of newline-delimited JSON records.

Note that the format is newline-delimited JSON with each line being related
to a separate report. To merge the objects together a tool such as jq can
be leveraged similar to the following:

.. code::

    jq -c -s 'reduce.[]as$x({};.*$x)' orig.json > new.json

JsonStream
----------

Generate a stream of result objects serialized in JSON.

NullReporter
------------

Reporter used for timing tests; no output.

PickleStream
------------

Generate a stream of pickled objects using the original pickling protocol.

For each specific target for checks, a header is pickled detailing the
checks used, possible results, and search criteria.

This reporter uses the original "human-readable" protocol that is backwards
compatible with earlier versions of Python.

StrReporter
-----------

Simple string reporter, pkgcheck-0.1 behaviour.

Example::

    sys-apps/portage-2.1-r2: sys-apps/portage-2.1-r2.ebuild has whitespace in indentation on line 169
    sys-apps/portage-2.1-r2: rdepend  ppc-macos: unsolvable default-darwin/macos/10.4, solutions: [ >=app-misc/pax-utils-0.1.13 ]
    sys-apps/portage-2.1-r2: no change in 75 days, keywords [ ~x86-fbsd ]

XmlReporter
-----------

Feed of newline-delimited XML reports.
